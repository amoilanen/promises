Static Methods

Promise.race(array);
Make a Promise that fulfills when any item fulfills, and rejects if any item rejects.
Note: Only implemented in Chrome as Promise.one. Also, I'm unconvinced of it's usefulness, I'd rather have an opposite of Promise.all that only rejected if all items rejected.

Constructor

new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {});
resolve(thenable)
Your promise will be fulfilled/rejected with the outcome of thenable
resolve(obj)
Your promise is fulfilled with obj
reject(obj)
Your promise is rejected with obj. For consistency and debugging (eg stack traces), obj should be an instanceof Error. Any errors thrown in the constructor callback will be implicitly passed to reject().
